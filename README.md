## Project Overview

This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where we come in.

## Why We Test ?
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard known as **_"test-driven development" or TDD._** This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application.

Whether you work in an organization that writes tests extensively to inform product development or one that uses tests to encourage iteration, testing has become an essential skill in modern web development!
